From the delicate and lush pads of the side A to the gloomy and noisy synths of the side B.\n\nRemember, son of Earth, that devotion is a divine law from which none may have dispensation, expect nothing, only ingratitude, from men. Let your heart be always ready to tender its account to the Eternal, if Arcanum XII appears in your horoscope, violent death will lie in wait for you on your path through life. But if the world makes an attempt upon your earthly life, do not die without accepting with resignation the will of God and without pardoning your enemies; for whoever does not forgive shall be condemned, beyond this life, to an eternal solitude.\n ___\nDISCLAIMER: All tracks are uploaded in a low quality for promotional purposes only and with buy links to respect label and artists.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hatecollective/\nor via email: hatemusic1@gmail.com\n\nFollow us on SOUNDCLOUD for exclusive podcast series:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/hate_music\n\nFollow us on INSTAGRAM for releases previews and news:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/hate_collective","youtubeChannelId":"UC6qQOTx9LuKMC5p2dbjmSRg","trackId":1,"category":0,"track":null,"youTubeChannel":null,"publishedAt":"2018-05-11T13:51:16","thumbnails":null,"thumbnailsEtag":null,"tags":null,"youtubeCategoryId":"10","duration":"00:08:39","lastUpdateAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","statistics":null,"topicDetails":null},{"id":"1CRZp7Gqom0","title":"Cirez D & Acki Kokotos -
